# Forest-Fire-Detection-using-ML

**Description:**

The project focuses on building a machine learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to detect forest fires from images. It uses a custom image dataset with two classes â€” Fire and No Fire. The model is trained to classify input images and alert if fire is detected.

**Key steps include:**
Data preprocessing and augmentation
CNN model building and training
Real-time prediction and testing with uploaded images
Model evaluation using accuracy, loss graphs, and visual output
The system can be deployed for early fire detection in surveillance systems to help reduce environmental damage and improve disaster response.
